React Project with Tailwind CSS and Props
Overview
This project is a simple React application where I learned and implemented the following concepts:

Tailwind CSS for styling
Props for passing data to components
Component-based architecture in React
What I Learned
âœ… 1. Setting Up Tailwind CSS in React (Vite)
I installed and configured Tailwind CSS in my React project using Vite. The steps include:

Installing Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer
Initializing Tailwind with npx tailwindcss init -p
Adding Tailwind directives to the CSS file (index.css)
Configuring the tailwind.config.js file
âœ… 2. Using Props in React
Props allow passing data from a parent component to a child component. In this project, I used props to:

Pass a username
Pass button text
Pass an image URL
Example:

jsx
Copy
Edit
<Card username="Nikhil" btnText="Click Me" btnUrl="https://example.com/image.jpg" />
âœ… 3. Creating a Reusable Component
I built a Card component that accepts username, btnText, and btnUrl as props. This makes the component reusable with different data.

Example of the Card Component:

jsx
Copy
Edit
import React from 'react';

const Card = ({ username, btnText, btnUrl }) => {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg p-4 m-4">
      <img className="w-full object-cover h-48" src={btnUrl} alt={username} />
      <div className="px-6 py-4">
        <div className="font-bold text-xl mb-2">{username}</div>
        <button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
          {btnText}
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Card;
âœ… 4. Using Tailwind CSS for Styling
I used Tailwind CSS to style the Card component. Key classes include:

max-w-sm â†’ Sets maximum width
rounded â†’ Adds rounded corners
shadow-lg â†’ Adds a shadow effect
w-full â†’ Makes the image take full width
bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 â†’ Button styling with hover effect
Conclusion
This project helped me understand the fundamentals of Tailwind CSS, how to use props effectively, and how to create reusable components in React. ðŸš€
